# CryptoAggregator

The idea is to create a simple crypto widget that will fetch current price from 
[CoinMarket](https://coinmarketcap.com/). 

After placing the widget on the home screen it will trigger update and when
received updates the price of given currencies. The price is also fetched
in a fixed interval.

## Controls

Configuration screen is accessible via touching on the currencies' labels.
You can configure which currencies to show.

To refresh currencies' value tap the amounts.

## TODO
* Add More currencies
* Specify how much you hold of each of chosen ones to see how much in USD you have
* Provide a sum of USD amounts
* Solve more than one widget config
* Revisit the presentation

## Note
Obviously there already is a lot of similar widgets out there, but I haven't found one that does
exactly what stated above. Also I would like to try to create a simple Android widget.
