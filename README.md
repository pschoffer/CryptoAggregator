# CryptoAggregator

The idea is to create a simple crypto widget that will fetch current price from 
[CoinMarket](https://coinmarketcap.com/). 

## TODO
* DI framework
* Refactor loading logic (kinda similar to updator)
* Refresh on touch
* Create a setting screen and a way to move to it
* Change what tokens to show (configuration).
* Specify how much you hold of each of chosen ones to see how much in USD you have
* Provide a sum of USD amounts
* Revisit the presentation

## Note
Obviously there already is a lot of similar widgets out there, but I haven't found one that does
exactly what stated above. Also I would like to try to create a simple Android widget.
